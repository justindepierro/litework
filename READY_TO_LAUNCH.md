## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Test Locally (Do This NOW - 15 min)

Your dev server should still be running at http://localhost:3000

**Quick Test Checklist:**
```
â–¡ Login/Signup works
â–¡ Create an athlete group (e.g., "Football Linemen")
â–¡ Create a workout using the WorkoutEditor
â–¡ Assign the workout to the group
â–¡ Check the calendar view
â–¡ Test mobile view (Chrome DevTools)
```

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Deployment (5 min)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your LiteWork project
3. Check latest deployment status
4. Current URL: `https://litework-p6uw3kn0c-justin-depierros-projects.vercel.app`

**Expected**: âœ… Deployment successful (green checkmark)

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Vercel (10 min)

**CRITICAL**: Your app won't work without these!

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ LiteWork â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

2. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Visit https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy these values:

3. Add these variables in Vercel:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://[your-project].supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJ... (long string)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = eyJ... (different long string)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://litework-p6uw3kn0c-justin-depierros-projects.vercel.app
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

4. **IMPORTANT**: Click "Redeploy" after adding variables!

### Step 4: Test Production Deployment (10 min)

Once redeployed with environment variables:

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Create a coach account (use your email)
3. Create a test group
4. Create a test workout
5. Test on your phone (mobile is critical!)

### Step 5: Domain Setup (Optional - 30 min)

**Option A: Use Vercel URL** (Easiest)
- Your current URL works perfectly
- Share this with athletes: `litework-p6uw3kn0c-justin-depierros-projects.vercel.app`
- No additional setup needed

**Option B: Custom Domain** (Professional)
- Buy a domain (e.g., litework.app, [yourschool]weights.com)
- Follow instructions in PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- Configure DNS at registrar
- Takes 5-60 minutes for DNS propagation

**Recommendation**: Start with Vercel URL, add custom domain later if needed.

### Step 6: Athlete Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Pilot (This Week)**
```
Day 1-2: Test everything yourself
Day 3-4: Invite 3-5 tech-savvy athletes
Day 5-7: Get feedback, fix issues
```

**Phase 2: Full Rollout (Next Week)**
```
Week 2: Invite all athletes in batches
        - Send 10-15 invitations at a time
        - Monitor signup completion
        - Provide support as needed
```

**Communication Template** (copy this):
```

## ðŸ†˜ Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Do athletes need to download an app?**  
A: No! It's a web app that works in any browser. But they CAN install it to their phone home screen (PWA) which makes it feel like a native app.

**Q: What if an athlete doesn't have email?**  
A: They can sign up with any email address (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.). School email is preferred but not required.

**Q: Can athletes see each other's workouts?**  
A: No. Athletes only see their own assigned workouts and progress. You (the coach) see everything.

**Q: What if we lose internet in the weight room?**  
A: The app has offline support! Workouts load and they can record sets. Data syncs when internet returns.

**Q: Can I assign different workouts to different athletes in the same group?**  
A: Yes! You can assign to the whole group, then modify individual athlete workouts if needed.

**Q: How do athletes know what weight to use?**  
A: You can specify weights as percentages of their 1RM or fixed weights. The app will calculate and display the correct weight for each athlete.

**Q: Can parents see their athlete's progress?**  
A: Not yet, but this could be added as a feature. Currently only coaches and the athlete see their data.
