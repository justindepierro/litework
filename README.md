This project is designed for weight lifting clubs and can be customized for specific team needs. The modular component structure makes it easy to add new features or modify existing functionality.

### Working with GitHub Copilot

When developing with Copilot on this project:

1. **Reference Context**: Always mention you're working on a "weight lifting club workout tracker"
2. **Use Type Definitions**: Reference the types in `src/types/index.ts` for accurate suggestions
3. **Follow Patterns**: The codebase uses consistent React patterns that Copilot can learn from
4. **Mention Specific Features**: Reference supersets, circuits, athlete groups, etc. for domain-specific help
5. **Design System**: Use the established design tokens and Tailwind classes for consistency

### Development Guidelines

- **TypeScript First**: All components use TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions

- **Role Hierarchy**: Admin → Coach → Athlete (admin inherits all permissions)
- **Row Level Security**: Database policies enforce data access at the database level
- **API Protection**: All API routes use centralized auth wrappers (`withAuth`, `withPermission`, `withRole`)
- **Frontend Guards**: Page-level protection with custom hooks (`useCoachGuard`, `useAdminGuard`)

### Security Documentation

- **📘 ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive development patterns and security best practices (650+ lines)
- **🔒 SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md**: Complete security audit findings and fixes (430+ lines)
- **🛡️ Centralized Auth Utilities**: `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` for consistent authentication patterns

### Recent Security Improvements (Oct 30, 2025)

- ✅ Fixed 6 critical unprotected API routes
- ✅ Implemented role hierarchy with admin permission inheritance
- ✅ Created centralized auth utilities for future-proofing
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation and checklists
- ✅ 100% API route protection coverage

### Production Deployment

- **Live URL**: https://litework-p6uw3kn0c-justin-depierros-projects.vercel.app
- **Platform**: Vercel with automatic deployments from main branch
- **TypeScript Validation**: All builds include type checking
- **Performance**: Optimized with Turbopack and Next.js 16
