# Athlete Quick Start Guide

Welcome to LiteWork! This guide will help you get started with tracking your workouts and monitoring your progress.

## Getting Started

- **Completed This Week**: Your workout count
- **Total Volume**: Weight lifted this week
- **Upcoming Sessions**: Your training schedule

## Starting a Workout

### Viewing Your Assigned Workouts

1. Go to **"Workouts"** in the navigation menu
2. See all workouts assigned to you
3. Filter by:
   - **Active**: Ready to start
   - **Scheduled**: Starting soon
   - **Completed**: Already finished

### Opening a Workout

1. Click on the workout you want to do
2. Review the workout overview:
   - Exercise list
   - Estimated duration
   - Coach's notes
3. Click **"Start Workout"** when ready

### View Mode vs. Live Mode

**View Mode** (Review Before Starting):

- See all exercises and target weights
- Read coach's instructions
- Plan your equipment setup
- Understand the workout flow

**Live Mode** (During Your Workout):

- Large, touch-friendly buttons
- Quick set logging
- Timer between sets
- Simple navigation
- Focus on training, not typing

## Recording Your Workout

### Starting Live Mode

1. Open your assigned workout
2. Click **"Start Live Workout"** button
3. The timer starts automatically
4. Begin with the first exercise

### Logging Sets

For each set, record:

1. **Weight Used**: The actual weight you lifted
2. **Reps Completed**: How many reps you did
3. **RPE (Optional)**: How hard it felt (1-10 scale)
4. Click **"Complete Set"** to move to the next one

**Example:**

```
Target: 135 lbs × 8 reps
You log: 135 lbs × 10 reps (RPE: 7)
```

### Understanding RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)

RPE helps track intensity:

- **1-3**: Very easy, warm-up weight
- **4-6**: Moderate, could do many more reps
- **7-8**: Hard, 2-3 reps left in the tank
- **9**: Very hard, 1 rep left in the tank
- **10**: Maximum effort, nothing left

**Why It Matters**: Helps your coach adjust your program based on how hard workouts feel.

### Following Exercise Groups

Your workout may include:

#### Supersets

- Perform Exercise A, immediately perform Exercise B
- Rest only after both exercises
- Repeat for all sets

**Example:**

```
A1. Bench Press - 4 sets
A2. Rows - 4 sets
Rest 90 seconds between rounds
```

#### Circuits

- Perform exercises 1-5 in sequence
- Minimal rest between exercises
- Rest after completing the full circuit
- Repeat for the prescribed rounds

**Example:**

```
Circuit (3 rounds):
1. Push-ups × 15
2. Squats × 20
3. Pull-ups × 10
4. Plank × 45 sec
Rest 2 minutes between rounds
```

### Rest Periods

Between sets:

- Timer shows recommended rest
- Red = Still resting
- Green = Ready to go

## Understanding Your Program

### Workout Parameters

Your coach may use specific notation:

**Sets × Reps**:

- `3×8` = 3 sets of 8 reps
- `4×6-8` = 4 sets of 6-8 reps (rep range)
- `3×10/10/10` = 3 sets, specific reps per set

**Weight Notation**:

- `135 lbs` = Specific weight
- `70% 1RM` = 70% of your one-rep max
- `RPE 8` = Weight that feels like 8/10 difficulty

**Tempo** (Four numbers):

- `3-1-1-0` = 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up, no pause at top
- `2-0-2-0` = 2 seconds down, no pause, 2 seconds up, no pause
- Tempo training builds control and time under tension

### Progressive Overload

Your program will gradually increase in difficulty:

**Methods:**

1. **Add Weight**: Increase load by 5-10 lbs
2. **Add Reps**: Do more reps with same weight
3. **Add Sets**: Increase total volume
4. **Reduce Rest**: Increase training density
5. **Improve Tempo**: More control

**Example Progression (4 weeks):**

```
Week 1: Squat 3×8 @ 135 lbs
Week 2: Squat 3×8 @ 145 lbs
Week 3: Squat 3×9 @ 145 lbs
Week 4: Squat 3×8 @ 155 lbs
```

### Deload Weeks

Every 3-4 weeks, you may have a lighter week:

- Reduced volume (fewer sets)
- Lower intensity (lighter weights)
- Allows recovery and adaptation
- Prevents overtraining
- **Important**: Still complete these workouts!

## Best Practices

### Before Your Workout

- [ ] Review the workout in View Mode
- [ ] Prepare equipment needed
- [ ] Do a proper warm-up (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Set up your space to minimize transitions
- [ ] Have water ready

### During Your Workout

- [ ] Focus on proper form over weight
- [ ] Record sets immediately (don't wait until the end)
- [ ] Be honest with RPE ratings
- [ ] Follow rest periods
- [ ] Ask for help if unsure about an exercise

### After Your Workout

- [ ] Cool down and stretch (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Add session notes if anything felt off
- [ ] Review your performance
- [ ] Plan recovery (nutrition, sleep, etc.)
- [ ] Check your next scheduled workout

### Training Tips

**Form First**:

- Perfect form with lighter weight > Heavy weight with poor form
- Video yourself occasionally to check technique
- Ask your coach if unsure about form

**Listen to Your Body**:

- Soreness is normal, sharp pain is not
- Adjust weight if something doesn't feel right
- Tell your coach about injuries immediately
- Rest when sick or overtrained

**Consistency Over Perfection**:

- Completing 90% of workouts > Perfect workouts 50% of the time
- Something is always better than nothing
- Short workouts count too
- Build the habit first, optimize later

**Progress Takes Time**:

- Noticeable strength gains: 4-6 weeks
- Visible physique changes: 8-12 weeks
- Major transformations: 6-12 months
- Stay patient and trust the process
