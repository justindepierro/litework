### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: LiteWork logo → Login page]**

"Welcome to LiteWork! I'm going to walk you through everything you need to know to start using LiteWork with your athletes. By the end of this video, you'll know how to add athletes, create workouts, and make your first assignment."

**[Screen: Dashboard overview]**

"When you first log in, you'll see your coach dashboard. This is your home base for managing your athletes and programs."

"Since this is a new account, we don't have any athletes yet. Let's add our first one. Click the 'Add Athlete' button."

**[Screen: Add Athlete modal]**

"You'll need three pieces of information: their first name, last name, and email address. You can also add their sport and position if you'd like - this helps with organizing later."

**[Demo: Fill in form]**

- Type: "John Smith"
- Email: "john.smith@email.com"
- Sport: "Football"
- Position: "Linebacker"

"Click 'Send Invitation' and your athlete will receive an email to create their account. They'll be able to log in and start tracking workouts as soon as they accept."

**[Screen: Athletes list with one athlete]**

"You can see John now appears in your athletes list. His status shows 'Invited' until he accepts."

**[Screen: Show email athlete receives]**

"This is what the invitation email looks like. Athletes just click the link, create a password, and they're ready to go."

### Section 2: Creating Groups (2:30 - 4:00)

**[Screen: Navigate to Groups]**

"Now let's create a group. Groups are really powerful - they let you assign workouts to multiple athletes at once."

**[Demo: Create group form]**
