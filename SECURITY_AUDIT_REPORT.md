# Security & Architecture Audit Report
## LiteWork Fitness Tracker

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Auditor**: System Comprehensive Review  
**Severity**: CRITICAL issues found and resolved

---

## Executive Summary

Conducted a comprehensive security audit of the LiteWork application, focusing on authentication, authorization, routing, and code quality. **Discovered 6 critical security vulnerabilities** where API endpoints were accessible without authentication. All issues have been resolved.

### Critical Findings

- ✅ **6 API routes** had no authentication (now fixed)
- ✅ **Role hierarchy** bug where admin users couldn't access coach features (now fixed)
- ✅ **Inconsistent auth patterns** across codebase (now standardized)
- ✅ **No centralized auth utilities** (now created)
- ✅ **Missing architecture documentation** (now comprehensive)

---

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Unprotected API Routes (CRITICAL)

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**  
**Impact**: Unauthenticated users could access/modify sensitive data

#### Affected Endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Data Exposed | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `/api/users` | GET | All athlete data | HIGH |
| `/api/users` | POST | Create users | CRITICAL |
| `/api/users/[id]` | DELETE | Delete any user | CRITICAL |
| `/api/messages` | GET | All messages | HIGH |
| `/api/messages` | POST | Send as any user | HIGH |
| `/api/kpis` | POST | Create fake KPIs | MEDIUM |
| `/api/kpis/[id]` | PUT/DELETE | Modify/delete KPIs | MEDIUM |
| `/api/bulk-operations` | POST | Mass operations | CRITICAL |

**Root Cause**: Routes implemented without authentication checks

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `withAuth`, `withPermission`, or `withRole` wrappers to all routes
- Implemented proper role-based access control
- Added audit logging for sensitive operations

**Verification**:
```bash
# Before: Returns data without auth
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users

# After: Returns 401 Unauthorized
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
# {"error":"Authentication required"}
```

### 2. Role Hierarchy Bug (HIGH)

**Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**  
**Impact**: Admin users blocked from coach-level features

**Description**: The `useCoachGuard` hook checked for exact role match (`role === "coach"`), preventing admin users from accessing coach pages like `/athletes` and `/workouts`.

**Affected Components**:
- Athletes page (`/app/athletes/page.tsx`)
- Workouts page (`/app/workouts/page.tsx`)
- All pages using `useCoachGuard()`

**Root Cause**: Missing role hierarchy logic in auth guards

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before
const hasRequiredRole = user?.role === requiredRole;

// After
const hasRequiredRole = !requiredRole || 
  user?.role === requiredRole || 
  user?.role === "admin";
```

**Verification**: Admin users can now access all coach and athlete features

---

### 3. Inconsistent Permission Checks (MEDIUM)

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Impact**: Potential for bugs and security gaps in future code

**Description**: Some components used direct role checks, others used permission helpers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

**Examples Found**:
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - excludes admin
if (user.role === "coach") { ... }

// ✅ Good - includes admin
if (canAssignWorkouts(user)) { ... }
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Audited all role checks across codebase
- Created centralized permission helpers
- Documented proper patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Centralized Auth Utilities (`src/lib/auth-utils.ts`)

**Purpose**: Provide consistent, reusable auth patterns

**Key Features**:
- `withAuth()` - Require any authenticated user
- `withPermission()` - Require specific permission
- `withRole()` - Require specific role (or higher)
- `hasRoleOrHigher()` - Check role hierarchy
- `hasPermission()` - Check permission matrix
- `logAuthEvent()` - Audit logging for sensitive operations

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  return withPermission(request, "assign-workouts", async (user) => {
    // Only coach and admin can reach here
    // user is typed as AuthenticatedUser
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  });
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Type-safe authentication
- Consistent error responses
- Built-in audit logging
- Self-documenting code
- Prevents future bugs

---

### 2. Role Hierarchy & Permission Matrix

**Role Hierarchy**:
```
admin (level 3) ─────────────────────┐
  ↓                                  │
coach (level 2) ──────────┐          │
  ↓                       │          │
athlete (level 1)         │          │
                          │          │
Permissions      ←────────┴──────────┘
```

**Permission Matrix**:

| Permission | Admin | Coach | Athlete |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| view-all | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| manage-users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| assign-workouts | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| manage-groups | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| view-own | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Implementation**: Centralized in `auth-utils.ts` for consistency

---

### 3. Comprehensive Architecture Documentation

**File**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (650+ lines)

**Contents**:
- Authentication & Authorization patterns
- API route security requirements
- Frontend routing & guards
- TypeScript conventions
- Error handling standards
- Future-proofing checklists
- API route inventory
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Migration guide

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for development patterns

## Testing Performed

### Authentication Tests

✅ All API routes return 401 without valid token  
✅ All API routes accept valid Supabase tokens  
✅ Role checks respect hierarchy (admin > coach > athlete)  
✅ Permission checks work correctly  

### Authorization Tests

✅ Athletes cannot access coach-only endpoints  
✅ Coaches cannot access admin-only endpoints  
✅ Admin can access all endpoints  
✅ Users can only access their own data (when appropriate)  

### Integration Tests

✅ Login flow works correctly  
✅ Navigation shows appropriate links per role  
✅ Page guards redirect unauthorized users  
✅ API calls include auth headers
